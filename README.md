Performance Test CasesÂ (continued)
1. Search Response Time Under Load
    * Precondition: System under simulated load of 100 concurrent users
    * Steps: Execute multiple simultaneous search requests with different filters
    * Expected Result: 95% of requests complete within 3 seconds under load
2. Filter Application Performance
    * Precondition: Search results are displayed
    * Steps: Apply multiple filters sequentially and measure response time
    * Expected Result: Each filter application responds within 1 second
Load & Stress Test Cases
1. Concurrent User Load
    * Objective: Verify system handles 500 concurrent users searching vehicles
    * Success Criteria: Response time < 4 seconds, error rate < 1%
2. Peak Load Handling
    * Objective: Handle sudden traffic spikes during promotional events
    * Success Criteria: System remains stable with 1000+ concurrent users
Security Test Cases
1. SQL Injection Prevention
    * Precondition: Access to search input fields
    * Steps: Attempt SQL injection in search parameters
    * Expected Result: Input sanitized, no database errors exposed
2. XSS Vulnerability Testing
    * Steps: Inject malicious scripts in search inputs
    * Expected Result: Scripts properly escaped, no execution in browser
Usability Test Cases
1. Mobile Responsiveness
    * Objective: Verify search interface works on various screen sizes
    * Success Criteria: All elements accessible and functional on mobile devices
2. Accessibility Compliance
    * Objective: Ensure WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
    * Success Criteria: Screen reader compatible, keyboard navigable
Compatibility Test Cases
1. Cross-Browser Compatibility
    * Browsers: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
    * Expected Result: Consistent functionality across all supported browsers
Reliability Test Cases
1. Error Handling
    * Steps: Introduce network failures during search
    * Expected Result: Graceful error messages, no application crashes
2. Data Consistency
    * Objective: Ensure search results match database records
    * Success Criteria: 100% data accuracy in displayed results
